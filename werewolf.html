    <p>Werewolves are one part "the crazies come out every full moon" belief that human behaviour changes during a full moon, one part animal urges for violence and one part Wolves attacking people while working alongside us.<br><br>

    The first werewolf was Lycaon, a greek who tried to feed human flesh to Zeus and was cursed to turn into a wolf and hunger for it instead. Werewolves have changed over the years, initially just a wolf with a savaged human mind, to changing from human to wolf and back again at will, to changing only in the light on the moon.<br><br>
    
    Modern folklore tells of humans changing into a hybrid form with the advantages of both the Human form and mind and the Wolf
    weapons and savagery, often dialled up beyond what has been observed in real world wolves.</p>
