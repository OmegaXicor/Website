        <p>Vampires are one part anti-cannibalism story, one part explaining the odd occurances<br>of dead bodies, which were rarely seen beyond the time of burial, and one part warning<br>of the outsider and the unknown.<br>

        The idea of a Vampire has existed for several centuries but the word itself originates<br>in English from the 1700s but the word's origin comes from Eastern Europe. One<br>agreement in all cultures is that the Vampire is a spirit (usually not the victim's) possessing<br>the body of a person that has recently died.<br>

        Vampires throughout history have had various forms, power and abilties almost too<br>numerous to describe but they are always evil and always to be feared.</p><br>

        <p>Despite it's many varied origins the modern vampire has settled on a very long-lived but pale, cold and<br>
        smooth skinned person with retractible fangs, destroyed by sunlight and able to turn into Bats, Rats, Wolves<br>
        or even a cloud of Mist.<br>
    
        They have various powers of mesmerism or hypnotism and can control those they kill by exsanguination as<br>
        thralls or those become vampires (and those bitten can be controlled). They have various weaknesses from<br>
        Garlic, Holy Water, running Water, Private Property to Arithmomania.<br>

        Modern vampires have become lords and ladies because being around for hundreds of years allows you to earn
        money, favour and power to ensure your decendants (or yourself in 50 years) and noble familes have so little
        new blood means they tend to look similar generation after generation. They do still enjoy/endure the coffins
        and the earth from their grave in some fictions. Most modern vampires are infected rather than cursed due to
        our cultural shift from fear of magic to fear of disease.</p>
