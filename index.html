<div><a class="home" img src="images/home.jpg"></a><p class="hometext">Although they evolved separately across the world Vampires andWerewolves are linked in modern culture as enemies.With Werewolves representing anarchy, librealism and living in harmony with nature, usually outcasts or enclaves within Human society.Vampires represent the opposite order, tradition and civilisation, usually nobility in human society.<br><br>

In the modern culture Werewolves represent freedom and often lose control when they transform, giving in to base instincts of desire and rage, the things we feel but don't act upon. Vampires represent the cold calculating power of someone in authority, free from the social niceties that human society is built upon, but Vampires need to feed on Humans and so are more protective of Humans than Werewolves tend to be meaning we often see these conflicts from the Vampires side with the Werewolves as the enemy.</p></div>
